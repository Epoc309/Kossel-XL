Kossel-XL
=========

Yet another large Kossel 3D printer using 20x20 aluminum extrusion, different from KosselXL (http://www.builda3dprinter.eu/kosselxl-released/)
XL means both "extra-large" and the abbreviation of my chinese name ;-)

For the look of it, please see the following pics:

Having known there are different implementations scattering around, but most of them did not give a complete set of files and designs, I decided to make my own Kossel 3D printer (see Reprap.org for further info about Kossel 3D printer). To me the goal is very clear: I want to build a Kossel with the follow features:

- larger print volumn than usual Kossel (I'm using 20x20 aluminum extrusion with the bottom edge = 330mm and height = 700mm)
- large print area ( almost the same as a standard Prusa i3 )
- magenetic ball joints
- lighter carriages sliding on the aluminum extrusion directly
- probeless auto-levelling 
- high precision at a reasonable speed
- heated bed 
- easy to assemble and maintain 

All the printed parts are implemented in OpenSCAD by myself! (But of course they are based on the original design of Kossel and other Kossel-type 3DPs such as Atom3DP etc.).


## Caution

This is a project in its very early stage. I'm still tweaking the design a lot. So using at your own risk!
